# HousePriceML

This project is pretty straight forward. From a dataset of houses with half of them having prices and other half not, I predicted the value of the houses missing the price using the data from the other half of the dataset.

This algorithm can be used to automate some stages of price evaluation in real estate business or to give a rough estimate of a house to potential customers.

#### Prediction accuracy at the moment is 88.45% and the price can be given in just seconds.
